# README

This is a simple project I've made for my neocities website (Since neocities doesnt allow to send requests to external servers such as PokeAPI used in this project). You can use it freely. <br />
Credit is not required but appreciated, if you willing to credit me use my neocities website: lazzl.neocities.org
